Agile vs. Waterfall Methodologies
Agile:

Advantages: Flexibility, iterative progress, early delivery of value, better collaboration.
Disadvantages: Less predictable timelines, requires constant stakeholder involvement.
Waterfall:

Advantages: Clear structure, well-defined requirements, ideal for projects with fixed scopes.
Disadvantages: Inflexible to changes, higher risk of delayed issues.
When to Use Agile or Waterfall
Agile: Best for dynamic projects like software startups or mobile app development.

Example: Developing a cloud-based collaboration tool.
Waterfall: Suitable for projects with fixed requirements like government systems or infrastructure software.

Example: Building an enterprise payroll management system.
Ensuring Quality Assurance
Methods:

Implement automated and manual testing processes.
Conduct regular code reviews and peer programming.
Use Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.
Document and track defects in a bug-tracking system.
Importance:

Reduces long-term maintenance costs.
Enhances user satisfaction and trust in the product.
Defining Project Scope
Contribution to Success:

Aligns team and stakeholders on deliverables.
Minimizes scope creep and resource misallocation.
